ClearCase-Tools version 0.01
============================

ClearCase-Tools is a collection of Perl Tools for ClearCase Administrators.
These meta-tools have evolved over the years to simplify the normal, not-
so-simple tasks that most ClearCase Admins, at some point, need to address.

As data base query tools, the ClearCase 'cleartool' and 'multitool'
commands leave a lot to be desired. (Imagine how successful Oracle
would be today if the only interface to their data base was similar
to these two ClearCase commands!)

The main use of these tools is parsing all of the output that spewes
from the various cleartool and multitool subcommands, and package it up
in an object that contains all of the various bits and pieces.

Another class is a simple OO wrapper for the ClearCase 'albd_list'
command. It is used to query a running ClearCase 'albd' daemon,
parse the output, and package it up in easily accessable pieces.
Note that only information on Vob and View servers is currently
parsed by this class.

Other classes include parsers for the ClearCase system's
'shipping.conf' configuration file and 'shipping order' files,
a class to convert a 'View extended' path ("@@" path) into a
canonical file system path by stripping out all branches and
versions, and a class to look for 'Out of View Space' errors
in a system's 'syslog' log file.


The tools described here have been used successfully with various 
ClearCase releases from 4.2 through 6.0, with the exception of 
version 5.x.
